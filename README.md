designing knee joint and calculating its angle

*designing knee joint*

i used CINEMA 4D programm 
1-i installed CINEMA 4D 
2-i used the objects (cube, cylinder) to create the bottom body of robot 
(see :( https://github.com/NoufTwakkul/ME-first-task/blob/main/README.md ) for more detailes)

calculating its angle
1- i desinged another leg part
2-i hid the cylinders part
3-enbled editing to cubes after i combined them together
4-i added four joints insted of cylinders parts from : charactor>joint tool
5-then i used rotation to move the leg
6-i calculated the angles using the IK chain from charactor>commands>create IK chain
(see :(https://github.com/NoufTwakkul/ME-first-task/blob/main/README.md) for more detailes)
